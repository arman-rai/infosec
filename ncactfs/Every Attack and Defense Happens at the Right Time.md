üß† Description:
Someone tried to breach a system‚Äîbut both the attack and the defense were caught... in motion. You‚Äôve been given a PCAP file that recorded the traffic during the incident. The trick? Not everything is obvious at first glance. Look closely at the timestamps, sequence of packets, and timing of requests and responses.

The clue isn‚Äôt just what was sent‚Ä¶ but when. Analyze the traffic. Reconstruct the event. Find the flag.
