# Introduction

It's rare when performing a real-world penetration test to be able to gain a foothold (initial access) that gives you direct administrative access. Privilege escalation is crucial because it lets you gain system administrator levels of access.

## Enumeration 
Some files to check out are
* `/proc/version`
* `/etc/issue`
* `/etc/passwd`
* 
Some commands to check out are
* `hostnmame`
* `uname -a`
* `ps aux`
* `env`
* `sudo -l`
* `id`
* `history`
* `ifconfig` and `ip route`
* `netstat`

### Finding files and folders
- `find . -name flag1.txt`: find the file named “flag1.txt” in the current directory
- `find /home -name flag1.txt`: find the file names “flag1.txt” in the /home directory
- `find / -type d -name config`: find the directory named config under “/”
- `find / -type f -perm 0777`: find files with the 777 permissions (files readable, writable, and executable by all users)
- `find / -perm a=x`: find executable files
- `find /home -user frank`: find all files for user “frank” under “/home”
- `find / -mtime 10`: find files that were modified in the last 10 days
- `find / -atime 10`: find files that were accessed in the last 10 day
- `find / -cmin -60`: find files changed within the last hour (60 minutes)
- `find / -amin -60`: find files accesses within the last hour (60 minutes)
- `find / -size 50M`: find files with a 50 MB size

- `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null` : Find world-writeable folders
- `find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null`: Find world-writeable folders
- `find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null`: Find world-writeable folders

### Automated enumeration tools
Several tools can help you save time during the enumeration process. These tools should only be used to save time knowing they may miss some privilege escalation vectors. Below is a list of popular Linux enumeration tools with links to their respective Github repositories.

The target system’s environment will influence the tool you will be able to use. For example, you will not be able to run a tool written in Python if it is not installed on the target system. This is why it would be better to be familiar with a few rather than having a single go-to tool.

## Privilege escalation using kernel exploits
Privilege escalation ideally leads to root privileges. This can sometimes be achieved simply by exploiting an existing vulnerability, or in some cases by accessing another user account that has more privileges, information, or access.
Unless a single vulnerability leads to a root shell, the privilege escalation process will rely on misconfigurations and lax permissions.
The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications. This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.

The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

1. Identify the kernel version
2. Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
3. Run the exploit

Although it looks simple, please remember that a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash. Make sure this potential outcome is acceptable within the scope of your penetration testing engagement before attempting a kernel exploit.

**Research sources:**  

1. Based on your findings, you can use Google to search for an existing exploit code.
2. Sources such as [https://www.cvedetails.com/](https://www.cvedetails.com/) can also be useful.
3. Another alternative would be to use a script like LES (Linux Exploit Suggester) but remember that these tools can generate false positives (report a kernel vulnerability that does not affect the target system) or false negatives (not report any kernel vulnerabilities although the kernel is vulnerable).

**Hints/Notes:**

1. Being too specific about the kernel version when searching for exploits on Google, Exploit-db, or searchsploit
2. Be sure you understand how the exploit code works BEFORE you launch it. Some exploit codes can make changes on the operating system that would make them unsecured in further use or make irreversible changes to the system, creating problems later. Of course, these may not be great concerns within a lab or CTF environment, but these are absolute no-nos during a real penetration testing engagement.
3. Some exploits may require further interaction once they are run. Read all comments and instructions provided with the exploit code.
4. You can transfer the exploit code from your machine to the target system using the `SimpleHTTPServer` Python module and `wget` respectively.

## sudo privesc
* Using the application functions to exploit 
* Leverage `LD_PRELOAD` [blog](https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/) 
	* `gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles`
	* `sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/ldpreload/shell.so find`

## SUID privsec
`find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null`


## Using capabilities
Another method system administrators can use to increase the privilege level of a process or binary is “Capabilities”. Capabilities help manage privileges at a more granular level. For example, if the SOC analyst needs to use a tool that needs to initiate socket connections, a regular user would not be able to do that. If the system administrator does not want to give this user higher privileges, they can change the capabilities of the binary. As a result, the binary would get through its task without needing a higher privilege user.  
The capabilities man page provides detailed information on its usage and options.

using `getcap` as it displays the name and capabilities of each specified file.
using some flags and redirecting the errors to /dev/null, we get the shell via GTFObins

## Using cronjobs
Cron jobs are used to run scripts or binaries at specific times. By default, they run with the privilege of their owners and not the current user. While properly configured cron jobs are not inherently vulnerable, they can provide a privilege escalation vector under some conditions.  
The idea is quite simple; if there is a scheduled task that runs with root privileges and we can change the script that will be run, then our script will run with root privileges.
