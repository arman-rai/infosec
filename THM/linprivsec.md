# Introduction

It's rare when performing a real-world penetration test to be able to gain a foothold (initial access) that gives you direct administrative access. Privilege escalation is crucial because it lets you gain system administrator levels of access, which allows you to perform actions such as:

- Resetting passwords  
- Bypassing access controls to compromise protected data
- Editing software configurations
- EnablingÂ persistence
- Changing the privilege of existing (or new) users
- Execute any administrative command
