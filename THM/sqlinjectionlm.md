**Relational Vs Non-Relational Databases:**  
A relational database stores information in tables, and often, the tables share information between them; they use columns to specify and define the data being stored and rows actually to store the data. The tables will often contain a column that has a unique ID (primary key), which will then be used in other tables to reference it and cause a relationship between the tables, hence the name **relational** database.

### UNION  
The UNION statement combines the results of two or more SELECT statements to retrieve data from either single or multiple tables; the rules to this query are that the UNION statement must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, the columns have to be of a similar data type, and the column order has to be the same.

### INSERT
The **INSERT** statement tells the database we wish to insert a new row of data into the table. **"into users"** tells the database which table we wish to insert the data into, **"(username,password)"** provides the columns we are providing data for and then **"values ('bob','password');"** provides the data for the previously specified columns.

###  UPDATE
The **UPDATE** statement tells the database we wish to update one or more rows of data within a table. You specify the table you wish to update using "**update %tablename% SET**" and then select the field or fields you wish to update as a comma-separated list such as "**username='root',password='pass123'**" then finally, similar to the SELECT statement, you can specify exactly which rows to update using the where clause such as "**where username='admin;**".

### DELETE
The **DELETE** statement tells the database we wish to delete one or more rows of data. Apart from missing the columns you wish to return, the format of this query is very similar to the SELECT. You can specify precisely which data to delete using the **where** clause and the number of rows to be deleted using the **LIMIT** clause.
